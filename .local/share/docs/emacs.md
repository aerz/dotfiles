# Emacs

## Installation

Since version `29.1` the Arch Linux team created the `emacs-wayland` package, which includes the native-comp, wayland and gtk3 branches. This is the one I use:

```shell
pacman -S emacs-wayland
```

This package deprecates the [emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin/) package I was using that worked so well.
